#Easy Lullaby player

My 18 m/o son loves one particular song, which is only available in Youtube (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lix-XLkFuvE). The moment we play this, he falls asleep immediately. 
One of my challenges with playing this at middle of night at 3am is that I have to open YouTube, search, play and then forward it to 1.5 min (as there is some story narration in beginning). 
By the time I do that, I would be wide awake ðŸ¥². I wanted a way to start this song with one click on my phone, and hence I built this website, which has the audio stored already, 
and let's me play it, with just one click :)
